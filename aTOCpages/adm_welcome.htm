        <p>Administrator instrumentation in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> is built right into the  interface. This guide gives detailed instructions on how to set up report entitlements, report search fields, and user accounts, as well as how to message the user base. It also contains useful tips on using the interface for greatest efficiency, and in the appendix there is an entitlements tutorial and recommendations for special case entitlement situations.</p>
        <p>You will also find useful information in the User Guide, which contains information  not covered in the Administrator Guide. The User Guide focuses on day-to-day tools such as searching for reports using the different report list views, search methods, navigating in the report viewer, extracting to Excel and PDF, and more. </p>
